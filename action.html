<td><p class="secondPClass"> Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an action-packed adventure-RPG inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit 
and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, 
the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the 
night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken. Resurrected by a Spirit 
of vengeance and empowered with Wraith abilities, Talion ventures into Mordor and vows to destroy those who 
have wronged him. Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that 
compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.

Every enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and
 weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and 
 decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay 
 session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers
 and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">The biggest addition by far with Mortal Kombat XL is the brand new characters that 
have been added. Altogether there have been 8 characters added to the game, and they are 
Jason Voorhees, Tanya, Predator, Tremor, Alien, Bo’ Rai Cho, Leatherface, and Triborg. 
Being the huge Mortal Kombat fan that I am, I was quite disappointed with the selection 
for additional characters. I feel there is too many characters from other franchises and not 
enough actual Mortal Kombat characters with some great character being snubbed for the likes of
 Leatherface. I understand that it’s cool to have 1 or 2 of these characters, but four of them are just way too many.

The stand out character that was added to the game has to be Triborg who is technically a 
“new” character… kind of. The character allows you to play as Cyrax, Sektor, and Smoke (Sub Zero is 
a sneaky secret option) via the variations options for characters. It was a smart way to feature 3 (4?) 
old characters, but put a new twist to it with the Triborg concept. As expected all these new characters come 
with a wide range of fatalities, brutalities, and their own endings once you have beaten the challenge tower with them.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">Infamous: Second Son is, in many ways, a large step away from the comic-book
 roots of its predecessors. Don't misunderstand – Second Son is very much an open-world 
 superhero action game first, and an excellent one at that. Its flashy powers look and feel 
 great in battle, and that’s really what  games like this are all about. But I didn't expect 
 to enjoy the weightier, more realistic tone of the characters as much as I do. It’s a change that 
 initially surprised me as fan of the franchise, but one that ultimately pays off. Despite failing to believably 
 marry the player's moral choices with the protagonist's own sense of right and wrong, Second Son hits some big high
 notes in both character interaction, and most importantly, open-world gameplay.
 It didn’t take long for Second Son's remarkable lighting to leave me staring slack-jawed at my screen. 
 The power of the PlayStation 4 is evident in every street-side puddle reflection and in every swirling 
 tuft of smoke that left my flaming hands. The city of Seattle is beautifully and diversely realized, but 
 it never looked better than when I was blowing everyone and everything around me to bits. Serene city streets 
 turn into fiery disaster zones with gleeful regularity.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">The world of Overwatch – despite being occupied purely by people, robots and celestial beings hell-bent
 on killing each other – is a wonderful place. Full of colour and jam-packed with character in every sense of 
 the word, this new take on the multiplayer shooter has the potential to completely reinvigorate the genre.

The characters are an important part of Overwatch and Blizzard’s shooter has a lot of them. 21 to start, with 
the promise of more to come following launch. And it is in this motley crew that Blizzard has done some truly 
amazing work.

There is an immaculate attention to detail in Star Wars Battlefront, making it easily one of the 
best-looking games of the generation. Battlefront's stunning visual fidelity is even stronger on PS4 
thanks to its modifiable settings. Cleaner textures, plus improved lighting and visual effects sell the 
exceptional aesthetic even better. Battlefront looks, feels, and sounds like the original trilogy in almost
 every way, from the scorch marks on X-wings to that specific spark and puff of smoke of blaster fire impacts. 
 The incredible audiovisual experience is so convincingly authentic that anything out of place stands out vividly.

DICE’s original score, for example, occasionally blends brilliantly with John Williams' original music, 
but sounds so wrong at times that I frequently turn music off entirely. And at best, the hero character 
performances and movie one-liners are weird and distracting. At worst, they’re pandering and awful.
DICE puts this great look and feel to use in a messy mountain of modes. Star Wars Battlefront is at peak
 quality in Supremacy, Walker Assault, and Drop Zone. These are focused, objective-oriented games that 
 leverage a deep set of sandbox systems so that spectacular things never stop happening.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">It’s a good end to Nathan Drake’s adventuring life, if not 
a great one, as Uncharted 4 brings the series to a close. Mechanically it’s the most confident Uncharted yet, 
with fantastic rope swinging traversals and satisfying fights, but there’s also clutter. Levels that would only 
improve the flow with their removal and an occasional overuse of interactions that only really get in the way

The revitalised gameplay is largely excellent. Where before the game was a linear theme park ride, there are 
now hub-like areas that are open to player exploration and interpretation. There’s more freedom as a result 
mixing in tightly scripted action with the chance to just sort of take it all in. Which is a plus as it’s also 
spectacularly pretty - jaw-droppingly so - from vistas and locations, to character animations where the slightest 
facial tic or muscle shifting under the skin brings Nate and company to life in an alarmingly eerie way.
Exploration is similarly enhanced thanks to these larger spaces. There are slopes to slide down, a 
rope you can use to swing across expanses, a piton that must be forcably smacked into surfaces to gain 
purchase and occasional access to a jeep in bigger areas. All of which combine to create a feeling of actual 
exploration with multiple routes and paths.  </p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">From the creators of Halo and the publisher of Call of Duty 
comes Destiny. With an unprecedented variety of FPS gameplay, Destiny promises to deliver an incredible story set within 
a newly-imagined, always-connected universe filled with action and adventure.

Everything changed with the arrival of the Traveler. It sparked a Golden Age when our civilization 
spanned the solar system ... but it didn't last. Something hit us, knocked us down. The survivors built 
a city beneath the Traveler, and have begun to explore our old worlds, only to find them filled with deadly 
foes. In Destiny, you are a Guardian of the last safe city on Earth, able to wield incredible power. Defend 
the City. Defeat our enemies. Reclaim all that we have lost. 
What new Destiny players will get if they pick up the game’s Taken King Legendary Edition 
is just staggering. Combined, the vanilla game, incremental add-ons The Dark Below and House of Wolves, 
and new, full-sized semi-sequel expansion are an insanely weighty proposition. Given that you can now get 
the entire package for the price of a single game the value is impossible to ignore any longer.</p></td></tr></table>
