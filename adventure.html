<td><p class="secondPClass">When pundits talk about a game changing the industry or 
leaving an indelible mark, they usually give the title in question a while to weave its way into the tapestry of our 
culture. Even though The Walking Dead: The Game is just now arriving as a standalone disc, there’s no denying the 
impact Season One from developer Telltale Games has had on video games. Using player choice, award-winning writing, 
and your own emotions, The Walking Dead: The Game delivers an experience that’s flawed but unforgettable.
Originally released as five episodes starting in April and ending in November 2012, 
The Walking Dead: The Game casts us as Lee Everett, a convicted murderer on his way 
to the big house. However, before Mr. Everett can trade his denim shirt for an orange 
jumpsuit, the zombie apocalypse breaks out and gives Lee new goals in life: namely, surviving at all costs
 and protecting a little girl named Clementine.It is these two goals that make The Walking Dead: The Game the juggernaut 
 that it is. See, The Walking Dead is an adventure game, but it’s not the kind of adventure game you’ve come to 
 expect. Sure, you’ll need to figure out how to get a radio working and how to distract walkers here and there, 
 but the real draw here is a “choose your own adventure.”</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">The walkers keep on coming. Season 2 of Telltale 
Games' The Walking Dead would continue the breakthrough adventure gameplay of the original.
Season Two continues the story that began in Season One. You are Clementine, a young survivor in a world gone to hell. 
The dead have risen to feast on the living, and the living cannot be trusted.
The story you experience in The Walking Dead Season Two is driven by the choices that you make. Because of that, 
your story could be very different from someone else’s. You don’t have to have played Season One or 400 Days, however, to play
 through and experience The Walking Dead: Season Two. Being able to shape how Clementine grows, develops, and how people react to
 her is the highlight here, and it’s where Telltale’s choose-your-own-adventure really shines. Throughout her travels,
 you're prompted with numerous choices--some are small, quiet moments that let you get to know your fellow survivors, 
 while others put the lives of your friends in the balance. Playing as a kid is way different than an adult, as they shove you 
 off to the side as they bicker and argue amongst themselves over petty disagreements.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">King's Quest: A Knight to Remember is a beautiful 
experiment in resurrecting the conventions of gaming’s past and dressing them up in the lush graphics available 
today. For the most part, it works, with this, the first of five episodes, telling a lighthearted fantasy story 
around simple action and rewarding puzzles about knights and dragons. The middle of its roughly six hours can drag
 a bit as you hunt down the items you need to progress, but even those are full of detailed art and enthusiastic
 performances.As with the classic King’s Quest game from 1984, a Knight to Remember is the story of the likeable 
 but overly excitable Graham, who's working his way toward being a knight (and eventually king). But this new 
 version is a quality reboot that tells an all-new story of Graham’s attempts to outwit four other candidates 
 for an open knight position, and it’s told capably enough that it should be appealing to newcomers as well as 
 veterans. The caveat to that is that there’s no tutorial or even a quest list to introduce new players to the 
 conventions of this old-school-style adventure and guide you through it, which means you’ll have to be comfortable 
 figuring things out on your own.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">The Last Guardian is the third game by the acclaimed 
development staff behind ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. In a strange and mystical land, a young boy discovers a 
mysterious creature with which he forms a deep, unbreakable bond. The unlikely pair must rely on each other to journey 
through towering, treacherous ruins filled with unknown dangers. Experience the journey of a lifetime in this touching, 
emotional story of friendship and trust.
The game has been shown to involve a young boy who befriends a giant bird, dog, and cat hybrid creature, Trico, 
and the two work together to evade guards that are after them both. The game requires the player, controlling the 
boy, to manipulate Trico like a real animal, such as luring it with food, as to use the creature as a means to climb
 and reach high platforms or other remote places. This sets the core of the game on puzzle-based action, as in between
 the various puzzles the player will encounter, enemies will be encountered, potentially impeding progress. It is the 
 player's role to survive in such an occurrence, much like in Ico.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">As far as games go, famed detective Sherlock Holmes 
has never looked or played better than he does in Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments. The latest in developer 
Frogwares’ adventure series uses Unreal Engine 3 for a much-needed graphics upgrade. The more disappointing news 
is that Holmes’ final deductions are based largely on a web of circumstantial evidence.Crimes and Punishments takes 
place over the course of six perplexing, well-written cases that give Holmes ample opportunities to do what 
Holmes does best: Snoop around crime scenes for clues, interrogate suspects, and talk down to just about everyone 
he meets. Murder is afoot in each of the cases, but that doesn’t stop them from being diverse; from a gruesome death
 by whaling harpoon to an Egyptian-style ritual killing, the plots had me riveted. And like a good winding mystery, 
 the person who did it is rarely the one you suspect initially.Some clues will require further research, such as 
 consulting an archive of old newspapers and encyclopedias, while others may need to be tested in Holmes’ lab. 
 Testing and picking locks present mini-puzzles that range from dreadfully easy to brutally difficult. A plus is 
 that overly challenging puzzles can be skipped without penalty.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">Minecraft: Story Mode will work as a traditional “save the
 world!” adventure for just about anyone, but big Minecraft fans will be able to enjoy it on a much deeper level. Cute 
 in-jokes like punching trees as part of a training montage, gathering nine slime to craft a slime block, and admiring 
 a chicken-torturing device made the Minecraft fan in me smile. I especially liked the couple of time-lapse building 
 sequences that show elaborate structures being erected, and the opportunity to “craft” story-critical items by placing
 them directly onto a crafting table.Even more impressive is Story Mode’s gorgeous in-game sets. Each looks like it was 
 painstakingly and lovingly created directly in Minecraft itself. It’s extremely authentic and impressive, 
 with lots of huge buildings and vistas to soak in, combined with plenty of tiny street-level details when 
 wandering around town.
Still, I wish there was more to play around with in these spaces. Minecraft’s trademark is its unrestricted 
freedom and interactivity, yet Story Mode Episode 1 only contains a couple true puzzles. Those that are here 
really work, though. They’re smartly integrated into the plot and environment, and feature clever solutions.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass"> No Man’s Sky is a game about exploration and survival,
 set in an infinite procedurally generated universe. Whether a distant mountain or a planet hanging low on the horizon,
 you can go there. You can fly seamlessly from the surface of a planet to another, and every star in the sky is a sun 
 that you can visit. Where you’ll go and how fast you’ll make your way through this universe is up to you. It’s yours 
 for the taking.
Every solar system, planet, ocean and cave is filled with wonder, but also danger -- and you are vulnerable. 
Your ship and suit are fragile, and every encounter can test your skills to the limit. From dogfighting in space 
to first-person combat on a planet’s surface, you will face foes ready to overwhelm you. And one mistake could see 
you lose everything. You can never take your voyage lightly. You’ll need to prepare. Collect precious resources on 
the surfaces of planets and trade them for the ships, suits and equipment that will take you to your destiny in the
 stars. Other players will also exploring the same vast universe in parallel; perhaps you’ll make your mark on their
 worlds as well as your own. In No Man’s Sky, every victory and every defeat has lasting consequences.</p></td></tr></table>
