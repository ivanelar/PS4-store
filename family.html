<td><p class="secondPClass">Personal expression through technical, athletic prowess 
is one of the defining pillars of skateboarding, and OlliOlli distills it down extremely well. There’s a sterile 
simplicity to its environments that initially lead me to believe its mechanics would follow suit, and initially they 
did. But after just a little learning and experimentation, OlliOlli opened up to reveal a fun and demanding, if slightly 
bare-bones representation of street skating.
Right at the title screen OlliOlli’s soulful, eclectic soundtrack washed over me like a soft breeze on a 
hot city day. It immediately establishes an atmosphere that its workmanlike representations of junkyards and 
cityscapes would struggle to evoke on their own. Mellow mixtures of sax, piano and percussion made me feel like 
the places I was skating through had a story, even when the visuals didn’t have much to say. Don’t get me wrong, 
there’s a painterly, understated quality to the multi-layered parallax backdrops, but on their own, they’re just a 
tad too mild-mannered to be interesting. With a soundtrack this excellent playing over them though, the net effect 
is authentic, and unmistakably representative of skater culture.

<td><p class="secondPClass">Much like skateboarding itself, the original OllOlli 
proved that there’s plenty of room for individual expression within the skateboarding genre. It hit the Vita with a 
fresh perspective, demonstrating just how great technical street skating could be in 2D. OlliOlli 2 blows that first 
effort out of the water on every level.

This is developer Roll7’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2. Like that landmark game, OlliOlli 2 introduces the manual, 
bringing a whole new dimension to the gameplay. It works in much the same way, letting you land in a manual out of any
 trick and thus keep your combo going, opening up the possibility of beating each level in a single monster trick.
 Each of OlliOlli 2’s levels are short gauntlets, jam-packed with stair sets, rails, ramps, deadly obstacles and – in
 the case of the Titan Sky levels – towering robots, hovercars, and toxic ooze. The skating is pure and skill-based. 
 Forget steering: this is a left-to-right stream of skating consciousness, where you’re flowing gracefully from one 
 mini set piece to the next, attempting to commune with the clever level design and trick mechanics.Flip tricks and
 grinds are the main tools of your trade. The former are triggered with a flick or swirl of the left analogue stick</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">Parents need to know that Risk: The Official Game is an accurate 
adaptation of the classic strategy board game, Risk. There are other "Risk" apps available, but if you want the true 
experience of the board game, this is the one you're looking for. If you're unfamiliar with the original game, understand
 that it is a war game about global conquest. You build armies and invade your opponents' countries. Battles are not 
 depicted visually in the game (you only see die rolls), but you will hear explosion sounds. However, the app does show 
 frequent images of soldiers with guns, as well as tanks and fighter jets.RISK: THE OFFICIAL GAME is another great board
 game-to-video game translation on the iDevices. The least fun part of the game of Risk has always been keeping track
 of who gets how many armies and what are their bonuses, and when they get cards and so on -- having the app take care
 of all that lets you focus on your strategy, and have a lot more fun while you're playing. The angry, camouflaged 
 paramilitary characters feel unnecessarily violent, waving their guns around and scowling. They put the game into a 
 modern war context, which is less fun and exotic as the Napoleonic era soldiers of the original board game.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">We all know those classic board games like Clue, Monopoly, 
Sorry!, and Candy Land. There was always that one board game that required players to use their brains a bit more than 
just rolling die and moving a piece. Everyone knows what game I’m talking about. That’s right, the word game Scrabble. 
Part of the Hasbro family of games, Ubisoft has brought the classic board game to the PS4.

So, for the few people that have never heard of the game, Scrabble is a word making game that takes place on a board. 
Players use letter tiles to spell out words and gain points for the number of letters and the certain letter that was 
used. The trick is, players must connect and use letters from existing words that have already been placed on the board – 
much like a crossword puzzle. Certain spaces on the board represent double and triple the points for letters and words used
 on said spaces. Whoever has the most points when all the letter tiles are used, wins.The game starts with a simple classic
 Scrabble mode, where players can choose to play against a ranging difficult AI, other players in local play, or online 
 multiplayer. Other modes are here but are locked behind UPlay, which is a big misstep for people just looking for a game 
 to play.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">Backgammon is one of the oldest games in existence, 
dating back thousands of years, and although in modern society it’s overshadowed by more popular timewasters 
like chess, it’s managed to find a home on the PlayStation 4 and its accompanying handheld, the PlayStation Vita. 
It’s true that in some instances the classics are best left alone – especially where an Alien movie is involved – 
but bringing this favourite into the digital age may yet prove a blessing for the ancient pastime.Backgammon Blitz 
is split into two modes: one is the classic game of old, while the other is a re-imagination filled with eccentric 
power-ups to boot the title into the 21st Century. The original option is flawless; truly, it’s cleverly designed 
to be playable by total novices or veterans looking to hone their skills. For those of you that don’t know, the activity 
plays a little like draughts, but with the aim being to get all of your pieces to the other side of the board in a 
left-to-right fashion by using a dice to determine the amount of spaces that you move. The instructions included in 
this version are clear and concise, meaning that you’ll get a grip of them in no time, though the more complex strategies 
will take some time to master.</p></td></tr>

<td><p class="secondPClass">I’ve played many iterations of Monopoly on various gaming
 platforms over the years, each one promising so much and never quite delivering. One of the biggest issues I’ve had
 with many versions is not being able to change the rules. Another annoyance was normally the slow pace a large 
 majority of the versions forced you to play at – an issue that was probably due to the processing power of the system 
 it was being played on.

Ubisoft never got back to me on the review copy request which worried me slightly but I had to grab this game regardless
 and bought it as soon as I had a break in reviews and some free time. I got the Monopoly Family Fun Pack which offered 
 the best value as it includes Monopoly Plus, My Monopoly and Monopoly Deal. You also get the Rabbids game board and player
 piece for free.
 Monopoly Plus is the main game which includes the new Living Board and the classic flat version that we are all used to.
 My Monopoly allows you to create your own boards, change the names of each property, and add a picture. If you have a 
 PS4 camera you can also add some of your own photos to the various locations and even in the center, sadly you cannot 
 edit or crop any pictures. Monopoly Deal is a card building game, more on this later.</p></td></tr>
