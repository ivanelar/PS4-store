<td><p class="secondPClass">Personal expression through technical, athletic prowess 
is one of the defining pillars of skateboarding, and OlliOlli distills it down extremely well. There’s a sterile 
simplicity to its environments that initially lead me to believe its mechanics would follow suit, and initially they 
did. But after just a little learning and experimentation, OlliOlli opened up to reveal a fun and demanding, if slightly 
bare-bones representation of street skating.
Right at the title screen OlliOlli’s soulful, eclectic soundtrack washed over me like a soft breeze on a 
hot city day. It immediately establishes an atmosphere that its workmanlike representations of junkyards and 
cityscapes would struggle to evoke on their own. Mellow mixtures of sax, piano and percussion made me feel like 
the places I was skating through had a story, even when the visuals didn’t have much to say. Don’t get me wrong, 
there’s a painterly, understated quality to the multi-layered parallax backdrops, but on their own, they’re just a 
tad too mild-mannered to be interesting. With a soundtrack this excellent playing over them though, the net effect 
is authentic, and unmistakably representative of skater culture.</p></td></tr>
